FreeVille is a version of so-famous [whatever]Ville strategic games easily found
at an also known social network but developed using open standards like HTML5
instead of Flash and with the purpose of being easy to modify and add your own
rules and functionality to develop your own social game.

Currently is being developed over Google AppEngine, but since the important part
is at the client (the web browser) being the server just a (big) database, this
should be easy to split at the future to develop new servers on other platforms.
